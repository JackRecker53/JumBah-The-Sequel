## Part 1: Introduction & The Problem (Presenter 1)

### ðŸŽ¤ Presenter 1 Script:

**(Slide 1: Title Slide)**

"Good morning, everyone. My name is [Your Name], and with my team, [mention other members' names], we are thrilled to introduce you to **JumBah: Your Adventure Companion in Sabah**."

"Sabah, the land below the wind, is a treasure trove of natural wonders, rich culture, and unforgettable adventures. But for many travelers, planning a trip to Sabah can be overwhelming. They face challenges like information overload, difficulty in finding authentic local experiences, and a lack of interactive engagement during their travels."

"Imagine trying to piece together an itinerary from countless blogs, reviews, and booking sites, only to miss out on the hidden gems that make Sabah truly special. This is the problem we set out to solve."

**(Slide 2: The Problem)**

"The modern traveler craves more than just a vacation; they seek immersive, personalized, and seamless experiences. The current travel planning landscape for Sabah is fragmented. Tourists often follow the same beaten path, while local culture and lesser-known attractions remain undiscovered. There's a clear gap for a platform that not only simplifies planning but also transforms the journey itself into an adventure."

"This is where JumBah comes in."

**(Slide 7: Deep Dive - Gamified Adventure)**

"Thank you, [Presenter 3's Name]. I'm [Your Name]. At JumBah, we believe travel should be an active experience. That's why we created the **Adventure Game**."

"This feature turns your exploration of Sabah into an interactive quest. As you visit locations, you can scan QR codes to unlock challenges, answer trivia about local culture, and earn points and badges. Itâ€™s a fun way to learn and engage with your surroundings."

"Imagine standing in front of a historical landmark, scanning a code, and receiving a mini-game that teaches you about its history. You're not just seeing Sabah; you're playing your way through it. The points you earn can even be redeemed for real rewards at our partner locations."

**(Slide 8: The Technology Behind JumBah)**

"So, how does this all work? Let's take a quick look at our **System Architecture**."

"JumBah is built on a modern, robust technology stack. The frontend is a responsive React application, using Material-UI for a clean user interface and Framer Motion for smooth animations. This ensures a great experience on any device."

"The backend is powered by FastAPI, a high-performance Python framework. This is where the magic happens. Our backend communicates with external services like the Google Generative AI APIâ€”specifically **Gemini 2.0 Flash**â€”to power MaduAI. It also handles all the data for locations, users, and the game."

"This separation of frontend and backend allows us to be scalable, maintainable, and efficient."
